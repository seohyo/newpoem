Use the arrow keys to change the position of a dot.
Use tab key to move the dot right with a big jump.
Once you have done moving a dot you can fix it
in one potision with the return key.
And then you will be able to start moving the next dot.

note:You cannot choose which dot you move.
     JUST FOLLOW THE NATURE.
